Dummy account details: It stores the initial account data with ID and balance.
Function Placeholder: The deduct_from_balance function is referenced but its actual definition is not included. This is because YAML doesn't natively support functions. You'll need to keep the function definition in your Python code.
API route configuration: This defines the /api/deduct route that accepts POST requests and maps it to the deduct function for handling the request logic
