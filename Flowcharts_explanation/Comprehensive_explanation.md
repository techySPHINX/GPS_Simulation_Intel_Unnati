## GPS Simulation Process

This project simulates a GPS system with distress detection.

Key Stages:

Data Acquisition:

Gather GPS data (real or synthetic).
Data Preparation:

Clean and pre-process the data for model training.
Model Training:

Train a machine learning model to identify distress signals.
Model Testing:

Evaluate the model's performance using unseen test data.
Integration:

Integrate a camera system (optional) and a virtual GPS device.
Real-Time Tracking:

Display simulated GPS coordinates and camera feed (if applicable) in real-time.
Distress Detection:

Use the trained model to detect distress signals in real-time.
Distress Response:

Trigger actions upon distress detection (alerts, notifications).
Pick Location Identification:

Identify potential rescue locations based on distress signals and GPS data.
Data Storage/Sharing:

Implement mechanisms to store and potentially share collected data.

Note: A flowchart structure is added as an optional visual aid.
