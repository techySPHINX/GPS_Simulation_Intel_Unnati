# GPS Simulation Process

**This project simulates a GPS system with distress detection**.



## Key Stages:

**Data Acquisition**:
👉 Gather GPS data (real or synthetic).

**Data Preparation**:
👉 Clean and pre-process the data for model training.

**Model Training**:
👉 Train a machine learning model to identify distress signals.

**Model Testing**:
👉 Evaluate the model's performance using unseen test data.

**Integration**:
👉 Integrate a camera system (optional) and a virtual GPS device.

**Real-Time Tracking**:
👉 Display simulated GPS coordinates and camera feed (if applicable) in real-time.

**Distress Detection**:
👉 Use the trained model to detect distress signals in real-time.

**Distress Response**:
👉 Trigger actions upon distress detection (alerts, notifications).

**Pick Location Identification**:
👉 Identify potential rescue locations based on distress signals and GPS data.

**Data Storage/Sharing**:
👉 Implement mechanisms to store and potentially share collected data.

**Note**: A flowchart structure is added as an optional visual aid.
