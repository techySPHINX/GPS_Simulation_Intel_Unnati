# GPS Simulation Process

**This project simulates a GPS system with distress detection**.

**Bypass Detection and Camera Surveillance**:

<p align="middle">The system considers bypass scenarios. If a vehicle exits the highway without going through a designated toll booth, no charges are applied.
The entire process is under camera surveillance to prevent unauthorized bypasses and ensure fair billing. This helps to identify vehicles that attempt to avoid tolls multiple times using the same booth.</p>

This flowchart depicts the process of a GPS-based toll collection system, considering bypasses and fraud prevention:

⦿ **Vehicle Enters Highway**: The vehicle enters a highway equipped with GPS toll technology.
<br>
<br>
⦿ ***GPS Module Activates**: The vehicle's GPS module automatically activates upon entering the highway.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Start Point Initialization**: The system initializes the starting point (startPoint) to zero, marking the beginning of the toll journey.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Alternative (Bypass)**: If the vehicle takes a bypass route (not detected by GPS), the system skips steps 3-10 and proceeds to step 11 (End - Toll Not Applicable).
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Vehicle Exits Highway**: The vehicle exits the highway, triggering the system to record the exit point.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **End Point Initialization**: The system initializes the end point (endPoint) using the recorded exit location.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **End Point Transmission**: The end point (endPoint) is securely transmitted to a cloud server.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Distance Calculation**: The system calculates the distance traveled (distance) using the start point (startPoint) and end point (endPoint).
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Toll Tax Calculation**: Based on the calculated distance (distance) and pre-defined toll rates, the system determines the toll tax amount (tollTax).
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Payment Initiation**: The system initiates the payment process for the calculated toll tax (tollTax).
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Payment Processing**: Processes according to server programming or connected to any cloud server like AWS which is set though jenkins.\
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Transfer to Payment Gateway**: The payment is securely transferred to a payment gateway for processing.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Transaction Success**: Upon successful payment completion, a notification is triggered:
<br>
⦿ **In-App Notification**: The user receives a notification through the app installed on their smartphone.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Bank Message**: A message is sent directly from the bank to the user's registered mobile number, confirming the transaction.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **E-Receipt Delivery**: An electronic receipt is sent to the user's email address via the e-governance system app, promoting transparency.
<br>
<br>

### Digital Signature Verification:
⦿ **User Verification**: The system obtains a digital signature from the user to verify their identity. This step is crucial to prevent unauthorized transactions.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Cloud Server Update**: Finally, the transaction details and user verification are securely stored in the cloud server, providing an audit trail.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **End (Toll Not Applicable)**: If the system detects a bypass or the vehicle has already been charged for the same toll booth (within a reasonable time frame), the flowchart ends here, indicating no toll is applicable for this journey.
<br>
<br>
⦿ **Camera Surveillance**: Throughout the process, the system operates under camera surveillance to monitor for bypasses and potential fraudulent activities.

## Key Points:

⦿ This system offers an efficient and transparent method for collecting tolls using GPS technology.
<br>
<br>
⦿ Bypass detection and multiple verification steps (digital signature, camera surveillance) aim to prevent fraud.
<br>
<br>
⦿ In-app notifications, bank messages, and e-receipts provide users with clear and convenient transaction details.

**Note**: A flowchart structure is added as an optional visual aid.

## Key Stages:

**Data Acquisition**:
👉 Gather GPS data (real or synthetic).

**Data Preparation**:
👉 Clean and pre-process the data for model training.

**Model Training**:
👉 Train a machine learning model to identify distress signals.

**Model Testing**:
👉 Evaluate the model's performance using unseen test data.

**Integration**:
👉 Integrate a camera system (optional) and a virtual GPS device.

**Real-Time Tracking**:
👉 Display simulated GPS coordinates and camera feed (if applicable) in real-time.

**Distress Detection**:
👉 Use the trained model to detect distress signals in real-time.

**Distress Response**:
👉 Trigger actions upon distress detection (alerts, notifications).

**Pick Location Identification**:
👉 Identify potential rescue locations based on distress signals and GPS data.

**Data Storage/Sharing**:
👉 Implement mechanisms to store and potentially share collected data.
