## Expanding the GPS Toll Booth Simulation

This project currently provides a basic framework for simulating a GPS-based toll system. Let's explore potential enhancements to create a more sophisticated model:

1.**Multi-lane Road Network with Exits**:

* Move beyond a single lane by creating a class or data structure to represent a lane with its capacity and current traffic.
* Introduce exits at specific locations, allowing vehicles to leave the simulated highway.
* Implement logic for lane changes and merging behavior when vehicles approach exits.

```
**Enhanced Road Network:**

This extension incorporates a multi-lane road network with exits. Vehicles can dynamically change lanes and exit at designated points, reflecting a more realistic highway scenario.
```

2.**Diverse Toll Pricing**:

* Define different vehicle types (e.g., cars, trucks) with distinct axle counts or weight classes.
* Implement a pricing structure based on vehicle type, potentially using dictionaries or lookup tables.
* Consider dynamic pricing adjustments based on traffic congestion or time of day.

```
**Variable Toll Pricing:**

The simulation can be further enhanced by introducing various vehicle types. Tolls can be calculated based on vehicle class (e.g., car, truck) using a flexible pricing structure. This allows exploring the impact of different pricing models.
```

3.**Graphical Visualization**:

* Utilize libraries like matplotlib or pygame to create a visual representation of the simulated road network.
* Display vehicles moving through lanes, toll booths, and exiting at designated points.
* Consider using color coding to represent traffic congestion levels.

```
**Visualizing the Simulation:**

Integrating graphical visualization libraries like `matplotlib` or `pygame` can bring the simulation to life. By visualizing vehicles traversing lanes, toll booths, and exits, the impact of traffic flow and different pricing models can be seen more intuitively.
```

4.**Complex Traffic Flow Models**:

* Move beyond random arrival times by exploring traffic flow models that consider factors like speed distribution, lane changing behavior, and following distances.
* Implement congestion modeling to dynamically adjust vehicle speeds based on traffic density.
* Incorporate dynamic pricing based on real-time (simulated) congestion levels to incentivize lane changes and optimize traffic flow.

**Advanced Traffic Flow Modeling:**

The simulation can be further enriched with more complex traffic flow models.
